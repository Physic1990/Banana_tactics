1. Brief summary of all 3 tests (purpose, rational and how it relates to the game): My Stress Test creates a unit every frame until the framerate falls below 60 frames to see how many units could be created at once.


2. Brief summary of work done on the game in the last 10 days (can I show it in the demo, are you on schedule?): I added more changes to varibalies and cahnged things about calsses none of that work is done but it is in progress.

3. Brief summary of road blocks and direction of work moving forward: I will be adding more Units and the data that is needed to support them as well as adding two attacks to each unit.
